This information includes information that you may need in order for this data to make any sense, for example, the longer explanatory form of the column titles.  

Feel free to use anything you find on that page.  Please don't search for analysis of this data anywhere else on the web (that would be an honor code violation, and likely not particularly useful anyway).

Good luck!
